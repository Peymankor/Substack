# Here is How I Hacked My Fitness With AI

- I will explain here to you  how to develop a fitness app with AI. It will be costumized, on teh web, foloow basic rule of fitness with tracking system. I think you can implement it in less than one hour. It Is fascinating to see how you can build such tools with AI, where a few yaesr ago it would be almost impossible. Lets get started:

## Workflow

This the teh workflow of how I build this web dasboard:

[![Fitness App Workflow](layout.png)](layout.excalidraw)


Essnetially, the workflow has three main blocks:

- The first one, is more to define goals, instruction and how to communicate with AI tool as it is Fitness Programmer
- In second, we use AI to generate the core of the webdabsoard simply with prompting
- Latsly, we need to adjust the source code, then deploy it on the web.

Lets get started.

### AI as Fitness Programmer

The first step to build this web dasboard is define our fitness goal to the AI. Here, I will use Grok3 to communcate with AI. After that I will ask AI to what muscles I need to work and what exercises I need to work on those muscles.

*Prompt to use with Grok3:*

```python
You are an expert strength and conditioning coach with extensive knowledge of muscle hypertrophy and body composition training.

My specific fitness goal: Develop a muscular, well-defined upper body with the classic "V-taper" physique (wide shoulders tapering to a narrow waist).

Please complete these tasks:

1. Identify the 5 most important muscle groups I need to prioritize for achieving this V-taper physique. For each muscle group, briefly explain why its crucial for this specific aesthetic goal.

2. Provide evidence-based support for your recommendations using brief parenthetical citations (e.g., research studies, established training principles).

Please think through this step-by-step, considering both the biomechanics of creating this aesthetic and the most effective training approaches.

```
We get the reply from the grok3 as follows:

```python
To achieve your goal of developing a muscular, well-defined upper body with the classic V-taper physique—characterized by wide shoulders and a broad back tapering to a narrow waist—you need to prioritize specific muscle groups that contribute to upper body width, thickness, and overall aesthetics. Below, I’ve identified the five most important muscle groups to focus on, along with explanations of their roles in creating this physique and evidence-based support for each recommendation. This selection is guided by biomechanics and established training principles for hypertrophy and aesthetic development.

---

### 1. Latissimus Dorsi (Lats)
- **Why it’s crucial**: The lats are the primary muscles responsible for creating back width, a cornerstone of the V-taper. Well-developed lats give the upper body a wider, sweeping appearance that tapers down to the waist, forming the “V” shape. They are activated during pulling movements, which are essential for broadening the back.
- **Evidence**: Research shows that exercises like pull-ups and lat pulldowns effectively target the lats, promoting hypertrophy and width (Youdas et al., 2010).

### 2. Deltoids (Shoulders)
- **Why it’s crucial**: The deltoids, especially the lateral (side) heads, are critical for achieving broad shoulders, which enhance the upper body’s width and contrast with the waist. Strong, rounded delts create the wide-shouldered look that defines the V-taper.
- **Evidence**: Lateral raises and overhead presses are proven to stimulate the deltoids, with lateral raises particularly effective for the lateral heads responsible for shoulder width (Schoenfeld, 2010).

### 3. Trapezius (Traps)
- **Why it’s crucial**: The traps, particularly the upper and middle portions, add thickness and definition to the upper back. This enhances the V-taper by improving posture and creating a robust, muscular frame that complements the wide shoulders and lats.
- **Evidence**: Shrugs and rowing movements are highly effective for developing the traps, contributing to upper back mass (Ekstrom et al., 2003).

### 4. Pectoralis Major (Chest)
- **Why it’s crucial**: A well-developed chest, especially the upper portion, adds mass and fullness to the upper body, enhancing the overall muscular aesthetic. While not directly responsible for the V-shape, a strong chest creates a balanced, defined look that supports the wide shoulders and back.
- **Evidence**: Incline presses target the upper pectoralis major more effectively than flat presses, making them ideal for chest development (Barnett et al., 1995).

### 5. Biceps Brachii (Biceps)
- **Why it’s crucial**: The biceps contribute to the muscularity and definition of the upper body, complementing the broader shoulders and back. While not a primary driver of the V-taper, well-developed biceps enhance the overall aesthetic, making the arms appear proportionate and strong.
- **Evidence**: Bicep curls and similar isolation exercises are staples in bodybuilding for arm hypertrophy and aesthetic enhancement (established training principles).

---

### Additional Notes
While a narrow waist is essential for the V-taper, this is achieved more through body fat reduction (via calorie deficit) than hypertrophy of core muscles like the abs or obliques. Overdeveloping the obliques could widen the waist, counteracting the V-shape, so the focus here remains on upper body muscle groups. The combination of wide lats, broad deltoids, thick traps, a full chest, and defined biceps creates the muscular, well-defined upper body you’re aiming for.

After running the prompt, we get the reply from the grok3 as follows:

```python
V-Taper Exercise Plan
To achieve a muscular, well-defined upper body with the classic "V-taper" physique, focus on the following exercises targeting the latissimus dorsi (lats), deltoids (shoulders), trapezius (traps), pectoralis major (chest), and biceps brachii (biceps).
1. Latissimus Dorsi (Lats)

E1: Standing Barbell Curls
E2: Preacher Curls

## Baseline level, and build  a 4 week program

Ok, as you know to do the exercises, we need to have a baseline level, so we cna start with that. And I am not going to get data for all of these execrsie. For simplicty, I am going to give only two simple exercises and then *extraploate* the baseline level for the rest of exercises.

  - Number of pushup you can do:
  - Number of pullups you can do:


With thes two data, we ask AI model to design the 4 weeks workout, with sets and reps for each exercise.

*Prompt to use with Grok3:*

```python

You are an expert strength and conditioning coach with extensive knowledge of muscle hypertrophy, body composition training, and periodized program design.

**My Current Fitness Level:**
- Maximum consecutive push-ups: 10
- Maximum consecutive pull-ups: 5
- Training experience: [Beginner/Intermediate - specify if known]

**Program Requirements:**
- Duration: 4 weeks
- Frequency: 4 training days per week
- Goal: Upper body muscle development and strength progression

**Available Exercises:**
A1: Wide-Grip Pull-Ups | A2: Wide-Grip Lat Pulldowns
B1: Overhead Dumbbell Presses | B2: Dumbbell Lateral Raises
C1: Dumbbell Shrugs | C2: Bent-Over Barbell Rows
D1: Incline Dumbbell Presses | D2: Flat Barbell Bench Presses
E1: Standing Barbell Curls | E2: Preacher Curls

**Please provide:**
1. A complete 4-week periodized program with:
   - Weekly progression strategy
   - Specific exercises, sets, and reps for each training day
   - For barbel weight and dumbbell weight, just estimate based on your knowledge given the baselien fitness level I have.

2. Brief rationale for:
   - Exercise selection and pairing
   - Weekly progression scheme

3. Recovery and progression guidelines:
   - How to progress when I can exceed the prescribed reps
   - What to do if I cannot complete the prescribed sets/reps
   - Recommended rest days between sessions

Format the program clearly with Week 1-4 layouts, making it easy to follow in the gym. Please think through this step-by-step.

```


I got thsi results:

```python
Here’s a 4-week, 4-days-per-week upper-body program built around your equipment, current abilities, and “V-taper” goal. We’ll rotate two workouts (Pull-A and Push-B), each twice weekly, with linear load and rep adjustments.

---

## Overview

| Day     | Focus  | Workout             |
| ------- | ------ | ------------------- |
| Mon     | Pull-A | A2 → C2 → C1 → E1   |
| Tue     | Push-B | B1 → D2 → B2 → D1   |
| Wed     | Rest   | —                   |
| Thu     | Pull-A | A2/1 → C2 → C1 → E1 |
| Fri     | Push-B | B1 → D2 → B2 → D1   |
| Sat/Sun | Rest   | —                   |

* **Weeks 1–2**: Hypertrophy emphasis (8–12 RM), using lat-pulldowns (A2) to build volume.
* **Weeks 3–4**: Strength/hypertrophy mix (5–8 RM), swapping in bodyweight pull-ups (A1) for raw strength.

All weights given are starting loads approximated to leave \~2 reps in reserve at the top of the stated rep range.

---

## Week 1

### Pull-A (Mon, Thu)

| Exercise                       | Sets×Reps | Load                  |
| ------------------------------ | --------- | --------------------- |
| **A2 Wide-Grip Lat Pulldowns** | 4×12      | 60 kg                 |
| **C2 Bent-Over Barbell Rows**  | 4×12      | 60 kg                 |
| **C1 Dumbbell Shrugs**         | 4×15      | 2×40 kg (80 kg total) |
| **E1 Standing Barbell Curls**  | 3×12      | 30 kg                 |

### Push-B (Tue, Fri)

| Exercise                        | Sets×Reps | Load                  |
| ------------------------------- | --------- | --------------------- |
| **B1 Overhead Dumbbell Press**  | 4×12      | 2×8 kg (16 kg total)  |
| **D2 Flat Barbell Bench Press** | 4×12      | 60 kg                 |
| **B2 Dumbbell Lateral Raises**  | 4×15      | 2×5 kg (10 kg total)  |
| **D1 Incline Dumbbell Press**   | 4×12      | 2×10 kg (20 kg total) |

---

## Week 2

* **Progression:** Add \~5% to each load.
* **Rep targets:** Same as Week 1.

### Pull-A

* A2: 4×12 @ **63 kg**
* C2: 4×12 @ **63 kg**
* C1: 4×15 @ **2×42 kg**
* E1: 3×12 @ **32 kg**

### Push-B

* B1: 4×12 @ **2×8.5 kg**
* D2: 4×12 @ **63 kg**
* B2: 4×15 @ **2×5.5 kg**
* D1: 4×12 @ **2×11 kg**

---

## Week 3

* **Phase shift:** 4×8 for main lifts; drop shrugs & laterals to 4×10.
* **Swap A2→A1:** Now using bodyweight pull-ups.
* **+5% load** again on barbell/dumbbell movements.

### Pull-A

* **A1 Wide-Grip Pull-Ups**: 4×5 (unassisted BW)
* C2: 4×8 @ **66 kg**
* C1: 4×10 @ **2×44 kg**
* E1: 3×10 @ **34 kg**

### Push-B

* B1: 4×8 @ **2×9 kg**
* D2: 4×8 @ **66 kg**
* B2: 4×10 @ **2×6 kg**
* D1: 4×8 @ **2×12 kg**

---

## Week 4

* **Strength focus:** 5×5 on main lifts; 4×8 on accessories.
* **+5% load** again on barbells/dumbbells.

### Pull-A

* **A1 Pull-Ups**: 5×5
* C2: 5×5 @ **70 kg**
* C1: 4×8 @ **2×46 kg**
* E1: 3×8 @ **36 kg**

### Push-B

* B1: 5×5 @ **2×9.5 kg**
* D2: 5×5 @ **70 kg**
* B2: 4×8 @ **2×6.5 kg**
* D1: 5×5 @ **2×13 kg**

---

## 2. Rationale

* **Exercise Selection & Pairing**

  * **Vertical pull (A)** and **horizontal pull (C2)** develop lats and mid-back for width.
  * **Shrugs (C1)** build upper traps to accentuate shoulder breadth.
  * **Push-press/bench (B1/D2/D1)** cover all planes of shoulder and chest to sculpt the upper torso.
  * **Lateral raises (B2)** isolate the medial deltoid for broader shoulders.
  * **Curls (E1)** twice weekly maintain arm size for a balanced silhouette.

* **Weekly Progression Scheme**

  * Weeks 1–2: Higher volume (10–15 reps) to induce muscle damage and metabolic stress.
  * Weeks 3–4: Lower reps (5–8) with heavier loads to drive neural adaptations and strength.
  * \~5% load increases week-to-week keeps the stimulus progressive without overwhelming recovery.

---

## 3. Recovery & Progression Guidelines

1. **If you exceed the top of the rep range** (e.g. hit 13 reps in a 12-rep set):

   * **Next session**, increase load by \~2.5–5%.

2. **If you fail to complete prescribed sets/reps**:

   * Keep the same load next session and aim to hit at least the lower bound (e.g. 10 of 12).
   * If you’re more than 1–2 reps shy consistently, reduce load by \~10%.

3. **Rest & Frequency**

   * **48 hours** between same workout (mon→thu, tue→fri) ensures full recovery of muscles & CNS.
   * Use Wed/Sat/Sun for active recovery: light mobility, walking, stretch.

---

**Stick to the load increases and rep targets**, listen to your body, and you’ll build both size and strength to achieve that classic “V-taper.” Good luck!

## Now, we need to build the webdasboard

For building the dashboard, I will use the manus.io for building dashboard for tracking.

Here is a prompt you can use with manus.io (or similar AI dashboard builders) to generate a web dashboard for tracking your 4-week V-taper upper body program:
