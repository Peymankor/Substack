# My Thoughts on AI and What's Coming Next

## The Big Change: From "How" to "What"

So today I want to talk about something interesting that I've been thinking about. The mindset of people and organizations using AI is changing in a big way.

Here's what's happening: AI is shifting our focus from "how to do something" to "what we should do." Let me explain what I mean.

In the past, the hardest part was figuring out HOW to build things. But now? The implementation is becoming super easy. Think about someone who wants to build a simple web dashboard. There are so many no-code tools available now, plus AI assistants like Cursor where you just write in plain English and it generates the code for you.

So what's happening is that implementation costs are getting very low. The real question now is WHAT idea you should follow. That's the important distinction - the "how" part is pretty much solved.

And here's another thing that makes this even more powerful: the speed of iteration is incredible now. When you have AI tools, you can experiment with ideas much faster. You can test them, improve them, make them even more interesting.

## What's the Role of Humans in This AI World?

This brings up an important question: what's the role of humans when AI can do so much?

My answer is that humans give direction. Think of it this way - we have these AI tools that are like powerful mechanics. They're very strong and capable, but we need humans to work together with these AI tools and then communicate the results to other humans.

The AI is really mechanical. It needs humans to guide it and give it purpose.

## The Wrong Question About Staying Updated

I get asked a lot: "How do I keep updated with AI?"

I think this is the wrong question. It's basically impossible to keep up with everything that's happening.

The better question is: "How can I use AI to be more productive?" 

Here's what I suggest: think about one project you want to build. Think about how you can bring your unique taste and perspective to the world. Then figure out how to work with AI to amplify that message and make it happen.

## What Skills Should We Teach Our Children?

Another question I hear often is about what skills we need to teach our kids for the future.

I think the most important thing is to help them become "high-agency generalists."

Let me break that down:

**High Agency** means being someone who makes things happen. These are people who aren't passive - they're active. They're the ones who act on their ideas instead of just thinking about them.

**Generalist** means having skills across different areas. Think about someone who understands a bit of technology, plus sales, plus marketing, plus other things. In the age of AI, success comes from bringing different things together to deliver value. And if you're weaker in any area, as long as you know the fundamentals, you can use AI tools to get stronger.

## The Danger I See Coming

Now, what about the dangers of AI? 

The one thing that worries me is what I see happening over the next 5-10 years. I think we're going to have a very divided society - split into two types of people.

**Hyper Consumers** - This will be most people. Think about chess - no human can beat AI at chess anymore. Well, the same thing is happening with content creation. AI is becoming the best at creating content that entertains people. So when you open TikTok, within the first minute you're hooked because the AI is working to maximize your entertainment. It's getting really good at keeping you consuming.

**Hyper Creators** - This will be a much smaller group. These are the people who use AI tools to create more and build more. If you're a high-agency generalist, you can use AI as leverage to amplify what you create.

The danger is that all these apps and social media platforms are designed to maximize your entertainment. The more entertaining they get, the more they turn you into a consumer instead of a creator.

## My Final Thought

So here's the bottom line: AI gives us incredible tools. The question is whether you'll use them to create or just consume.

The future belongs to the creators who can pick good ideas and use AI to bring them to life.
